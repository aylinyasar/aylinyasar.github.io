<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>What is the Marfan Syndrome?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>There
are a very wide connective tissue that holds the cells together and shapes the
tissue and connect them and organs together in our body. Also, the connective
tissue have the important role to help improving the body properly. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Marfan
syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the connective tissue of the body.
Fibrillin is the important material of elastic tissue and the formation of the
fibril occur defect in marfan syndrome. The defect causes inability the support
task of the connective tissue. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Because
of the connective tissue is found throughout of the body, Marfan syndrome can
affect many different parts of the body. It most commonly affects the heart,
eyes, blood vessels and skeleton. For instance, aortic enlargement can be
life-threatening. The lungs, skin and nervous system may also be affected.
Marfan syndrome does not affect intelligence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Mutations
in the FBN1 gene cause Marfan syndrome. The FBN1 gene provides instructions for
making a protein called fibrillin-1. Fibrillin-1 attaches to other fibrillin-1
proteins and other molecules to form threadlike filaments called microfibrils.
Microfibrils become part of the fibers that provide strength and flexibility to
connective tissue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Microfibrils
store a protein called transforming growth factor beta (TGF-&#946;), a critical
growth factor. TGF-&#946; affects development by helping to control the growth
and division of cells, the process by which cells mature to carry out specific
functions (differentiation), cell movement, and the self-destruction of cells.
Microfibrils help regulate the availability of TGF-&#946;, which is inactivated
when stored in microfibrils and activated when released. A mutation in the FBN1
gene can reduce the amount of functional fibrillin-1 that is available to form
microfibrils, which leads to decreased microfibril formation. As a result,
excess growth factors are released and elasticity in many tissues is decreased,
leading to overgrowth and instability of tissues.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Who has Marfan syndrome?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>About
1 in 5,000 people have Marfan syndrome. This syndrome affects men, women, and
children, and has been found among people of all races and ethnic backgrounds.
About 3 out of 4 people with Marfan syndrome inherit it. But, when this happens
it is called a spontaneous mutation, some people with Marfan syndrome are the
first in their family to have it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>There
is a 50 percent chance that a person with Marfan syndrome will pass along the
genetic mutation each time they have a child.                                                                                                                                                                                  </span></p>
